## 🧪 Database Schema (via Supabase)

```sql
-- Tasks table
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  due_date DATE,
  priority TEXT CHECK (priority IN ('low', 'medium', 'high')),
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'To Do',
  category TEXT,
  reminder_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  recurrence TEXT DEFAULT 'none',
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Categories
CREATE TABLE categories (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Profiles
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users ON DELETE CASCADE,
  email TEXT UNIQUE,
  full_name TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Triggers for new users
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO profiles (id, email, full_name)
  VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.email, NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name');
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_new_user();

```

## Recently Added Features (May 24th, 2025)

1. Remove Task Feature
- **Delete Button**: Added a trash icon button to each task card that's styled in red to indicate it's a destructive action
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Implemented an AlertDialog that asks users to confirm before deleting a task to prevent accidental deletions
- **Clear Messaging**: The confirmation dialog shows the specific task title and warns that the action cannot be undone
- **Visual Feedback**: The delete button has hover effects and the confirmation button is styled with a red background to emphasize the destructive nature

The delete functionality uses the existing deleteTask function from the `TaskContext`, so it will properly remove tasks from both the database and local state, and show appropriate toast notifications.

2. User Isolation Features:
- **Tasks are User-Specific**: Each task is linked to a `user_id`, so users only see their own tasks
- **Categories are User-Specific**: Categories are also linked to `user_id`, so each user has their own set of categories
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: The webapp database has RLS policies that ensure users can only access their own data

3. **GSAP animations** including 3D tilt effects on task cards, smooth hover animations, bouncy button interactions, and elegant entrance animations for all components.
